    "Welcome to the Confidence Regions Workshop at OHBM 2023! This workshop will introduce you to the concept of Confidence Regions (CRs) and how they can be used to make inferences about brain activity. The session shall cover the generation of CRs for excursion sets derived from %BOLD maps, and demonstrate CRs using a range of examples. By the end of this workshop, you will have a better understanding of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What CRs are, both conceptually and mathematically.\n",
    "- When you may want to use CRs, and why.\n",
    "- The factors that influence the size and shape of CRs.\n",
    "- Common pitfalls of CR interepretation.\n",
    "- What software is available to generate CRs, and how to use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will discuss CRs in the context of the recent debate about the use of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST) in neuroimaging, and explain how CRs can be used to complement NHST. We shall also show how CRs can be generated for effect size images, as well as BOLD maps.\n",

    "In the experiment, 77 subjects performed two tasks spread across two runs where each run contained four blocks. During each block, the subject undertook either a 2-back memory task or a 0-back control task. The experimental design was arranged such that, in each run, two blocks were designated to the 2-back memory task, and two blocks were designated to the 0-back control task. In each block a subject was shown a stimuli image (a picture of a face or a place, for instance) and then asked to recall the image they were shown. They were either asked to recall the most recent image (the '0-back' image) or the image shown to them two images prior (the '2-back' image). Interest lies in assessing whether this delay impacted the \\%BOLD response.\n",

In each first-level analysis, the task design was regressed onto Blood Oxygenation Level Dependent (BOLD) response and a Contrast Parameter Estimate (COPE) map was generated. Each COPE map represents, for a given subject, the difference in BOLD response between the subject performing the 2-back task and the 0-back task (e.g $L\\hat{\\beta}=\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{2-Back}}-\\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{0-Back}})$).\n",
